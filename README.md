# Project Name:

To-Do-List Website with React

## Motivation

As I delved into the world of React, the desire to create something practical without relying on tutorials emerged. The result? A To-Do-List website built using Viteâ€”an exploration of React concepts beyond the basics.

## Project Overview

This To-Do-List ensures seamless task management, allowing users to edit and add tasks while preserving data integrity, even if the website or server is closed.

## Features

1. **Add Tasks**

   - Click a button to add a task with an editable placeholder.

2. **Inline Editing of Tasks**

   - Easily edit tasks by clicking on them. Save changes or cancel for no modifications.

3. **Deleting Tasks**

   - Empty tasks automatically vanish, keeping the list clutter-free.

4. **Strikethrough Tasks**

   - Checkbox-driven task completion visualization in the form of strikethrough text.

5. **Switch Themes**

   - Dark and light themes for a personalized visual experience.

6. **Maintaining Task, Theme, and Checked List Data**

   - Data persistence through Local Storage ensures your tasks, themes, and checked items endure beyond sessions.

## Learnings

This project served as a practical lesson in persistent storage and the fundamentals of web styling while applying React concepts.

## Future Improvements

1. **Sorting by Priority**

   - Consider enhancing organization by introducing task priority sorting.

2. **Background Aspect Ratio**

   - Optimize background images for a seamless and visually pleasing appearance.

3. **Overall Style**
   - Elevate the aesthetics with animations and additional design elements.
